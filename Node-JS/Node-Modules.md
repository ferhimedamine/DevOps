#Node Modules

Modules are the way to include external functionality in your node application.

       Modules can export :    
        1. Variable
        2. Functions
        3. Objects


There are three main sources of the modules:

       1. Built-in Modules
       2. 
       3. 
 
 
# Built-in Modules

1. They come pre packaged with the Node.

2. Are require()'d by a simple string identifier.
       
       var fs =require('fs')
       
3. Below are some Built-in Modules

       fs  --->  accessing file system
       http  ---> creating and responding http request
       crypto  --->  for cryptographic operations
       os
